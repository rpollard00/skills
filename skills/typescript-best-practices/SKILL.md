# TypeScript best practices

Apply the `principle-type-system-discipline` principle skill first.

- Discriminated unions: Model variants with a `kind` literal discriminant so impossible states can't be represented. No optional-field bags.
- Branded types: Brand primitives with `& { readonly __brand: "X" }` so they can't be mixed up. Validate once at the boundary.
- Constructive modeling: Use `[T, ...T[]]` for non-empty lists and `[T, T][]` for even length. Store a start plus a validated nonnegative duration instead of independent endpoints. Validate constituent values at the boundary when their primitive types admit invalid values.
- Simplest total type: Keep `T[]` while every operation on it stays total. Strengthen to `NonEmpty<T>` only where the loose type forces `!`, a cast, or a "should never happen" throw.
- `unknown` over `any`: External data is `unknown`.
- Schemas before guards: Before hand-writing a property-by-property type guard, use the repository's runtime schema library and infer the type from the schema, such as `z.infer`.
- No unchecked `as` casts: Prefer narrowing or an existing schema. Use an assertion only after complete validation of the claimed invariant.
- Narrowing hierarchy: Discriminant switch > `in` operator > `typeof`/`instanceof` > user-defined type guard > `as`.
- Type guards: Must verify the claim. A lying guard is worse than `as` because the bug hides behind a name that says it's safe. Name them `isX` or `hasX`.
- Exhaustiveness: Inline `const _exhaustive: never = x;` in default arms so the compiler errors when a new variant is added.
- `satisfies` over `as`: Validates the value without widening literal types.
- Boundary validation: Parse where data crosses in, into a named domain type. `Record<string, unknown>` (however spelled) stops at that parse. Trust types inside. See the `principle-boundary-discipline` principle skill.
- Schema-derived types: Reach for `Pick`/`Omit`/`Parameters`/`ReturnType`/`Awaited`/`typeof` before declaring a new interface.
- Object args: Pass objects, not positional, so argument order is self-documenting. Skip on hot paths (per-frame render, tokenizers, parsers).
- Real tests: Don't mock what you can run. Prefer the framework's real test primitives with leak/disposable checks, and verify UI in a running build. Mock only what you can't run locally.
- Structured telemetry: Prefer structured logger diagnostics with enough context to debug from an id. No `console.log` in shipped code.
